You are an expert Next.js 14+ Developer.
Your task is to write a single, production-ready React component.

**My Request:** I want you to build the component(s) described in this feature file: "{{args}}"

**THE GOLDEN RULE (You MUST follow this):**
1.  **Read the Master Plan:** Read `docs/source/srs.md` for overall project context.
2.  **Read the Feature Plan:** Read the feature plan file at "{{args}}" to understand the *specific requirements* for this component (props, logic, etc.).
3.  **Read ALL Rulebooks:**
    * `contexts/typescript.md` (for types)
    * `contexts/nextjs.md` (for Server/Client component rules)
    * `contexts/tailwind.md` (for styling, including v4 CSS-first rules)
    * `contexts/debugging.md` (for debugging, legacy cleanup, and development phases)
4.  **Execute:**
    * Write the complete, production-ready `.tsx` file for the component.
    * **Include comments** in the code explaining your logic.
    * State clearly at the top if it's a Server Component or a Client Component (using `'use client'` if needed).
    * Use the exact naming conventions and patterns from the rulebooks.
