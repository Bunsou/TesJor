You are a Senior Product Manager.
Your task is to generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a *specific part* of my project.

**My Request:** I want to focus on: "{{args}}"

**YOUR WORKFLOW:**
1.  **Read the Master Plan:** First, you MUST read the `docs/source/srs.md` file to understand the *entire* project's business logic and requirements.
2.  **Focus on the Topic:** Filter your context to only the parts of the `srs.md` that are relevant to "{{args}}".
3.  **Generate the PRD:** Write a complete, detailed PRD for this *specific topic*. The PRD must be in Markdown format and include:
    * **Title:** (e.g., `# PRD: User Authentication System`)
    * **Related to:** (Link back to the main `docs/source/srs.md`)
    * **1. Overview:** A brief summary of this topic.
    * **2. User Stories:** A list of all relevant user stories.
    * **3. Functional Requirements:** A detailed, itemized list of what this system must do.
    * **4. Non-Functional Requirements:** (e.g., Security, Performance, Accessibility).
    * **5. Open Questions:** Any ambiguities you found.
4.  **Suggest Filename:** At the very end of your response, suggest a filename for me to save this as (e.g., `Suggested filename: docs/prd/prd-001-authentication.md`).
