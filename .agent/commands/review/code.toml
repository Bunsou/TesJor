**YOUR WORKFLOW:**
1.  **Read ALL Rulebooks:**

    * `contexts/nextjs.md`
    * `contexts/tailwind.md`
    * `contexts/api.md`
    * `contexts/structure_template.md`
    * `contexts/debugging.md` (check for legacy code, unused imports, backward compat cruft)
2.  **Analyze the Code:** Look for:
    * Type safety issues
    * Server/Client component violations
    * Security vulnerabilities
    * Performance issues
    * Accessibility concerns
    * Standards violations
3.  **Provide Feedback:** Format as:
