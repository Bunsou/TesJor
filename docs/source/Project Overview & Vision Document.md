Here is a **Project Overview & Vision Document**.

This document is designed for investors, partners, tourism officials, or general readers. It avoids technical jargon (like "PWA," "React," or "Backend") and focuses on the **user experience, the problem we are solving, and the value of the project.**

# Project Proposal: TesJor

**"Unlock the Real Cambodia, One Quest at a Time"**

## 1. The Concept in Brief

**TesJor** is a digital travel companion designed to solve the biggest problem in Cambodian tourism: **"Where do I go after Angkor Wat?"**

Instead of a boring directory of places, we turn travel into a **game**. We provide tourists with curated "checklists" of hidden villages, authentic foods, and local events. Users explore the country, check off items on their digital passport, and earn badges for discovering the "real" Cambodia.

It is accessible immediately via any web browser on a phone—no app download required.

## 2. The Problem

While Cambodia is rich in culture, most tourism is concentrated in a few small areas (mainly the temples of Siem Reap).

- **The "Tourist Bubble":** Visitors often stick to the main path because they lack information about safe, interesting places in rural areas.
- **Missed Economic Opportunity:** Small villages, local artisans, and family-run food stalls miss out on tourism revenue because no one knows they exist.
- **Lack of Guidance:** Tourists want authentic experiences (like "eating real street food") but don't know what to order or where to find it.

## 3. Our Solution: The "Quest" System

We are building a platform that guides tourists to these hidden gems by making it fun and organized.

### How it Works for the User:

1.  **Instant Access:** The user opens our website link. It looks and feels exactly like a mobile app, but they don't need to waste time downloading anything from an App Store. They sign in instantly with their **Gmail** account.
2.  **Discover:** They browse curated categories like _"Hidden Villages," "Must-Try Khmer Drinks,"_ or _"Traditional Crafts."_
3.  **Plan:** They can **Bookmark** places they want to visit or foods they want to try, creating a personal itinerary.
4.  **Navigate:** They use our **Interactive Map** to see hidden gems near their current location.
5.  **Complete the Quest:** When they visit a place or eat a dish, they tap **"Check-in"** on the app. This marks it as complete in their history, filling up their "Digital Passport."

## 4. Key Features

### 🗺️ The Interactive Map

A visual guide to Cambodia. Users can see where they are and spot colorful pins nearby—green for nature, orange for food, purple for culture. It takes the fear out of getting lost.

### 📋 The Checklist & Bookmarks

Travelers love lists. We provide curated lists (e.g., _"The Top 10 Khmer Souvenirs"_). Users can save items to their personal "Saved" list so they don't forget where they wanted to go.

### 🏆 The Digital Passport (Gamification)

This is the heart of the fun. As users visit places, their profile updates.

- _Visited 5 Villages?_ You get a progress update.
- _Ate Nom Banh Chok?_ Check it off the list.
  This gives tourists a sense of accomplishment and encourages them to stay longer to "finish the list."

### 🔍 Curated Content (Quality Control)

Unlike Google Maps, which is messy, our platform only lists verified, high-quality, and safe locations. We provide the Khmer name (for showing TukTuk drivers), the history, and practical tips.

## 5. The Impact

This project is about more than just a holiday; it’s about **distributing value.**

- **For the Tourist:** They get a unique, authentic story to tell back home, far beyond the standard temple photos.
- **For the Locals:** We drive foot traffic to small businesses, homestays, and street vendors who usually don't have marketing budgets.
- **For the Culture:** By turning local products (like Palm Juice or Krama) into "Quest Items," we increase their value and demand, helping preserve these traditions.

---

## 6. Future Vision

While we are starting with the "Checklist" features, our roadmap includes:

- **Rewards:** Partnering with local businesses to offer discounts to users who complete specific quests.
- **Community:** allowing users to share their progress.
- **Booking:** Allowing users to book homestays or experiences directly.

### Summary

**TesJor** bridges the gap between the adventurous tourist and the hidden beauty of Cambodia. It is simple to use, fun to play, and powerful for the local economy.
